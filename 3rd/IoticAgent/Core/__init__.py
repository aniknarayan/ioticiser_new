"""IoticAgent.Core module provides a Thread Safe AMQP Client connection to the Iotic Labs QAPI

Calling a request function returns a Core.RequestEvent instance on which the caller can .wait
Or check using the RequestEvent.is_set function

When the event is complete event.requestId, success and payload will be populated.
RequestEvent._messages will contain the raw messages from the queue.
